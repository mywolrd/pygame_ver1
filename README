pygame game

sound files go to snd/ directory.
image files go to img/ directory.
Their names must be in this specific format(maybe add exception later to catch this).

"level number"_"file name".extension
level0_hello.mp3
level0_img1.png

find img and sound sources(credit)

stage directory holds stages(mini games).
They must inherit from "class stage" and implement run(), next_level().

main.py is the main loop.
Manager.py is a game manager. It holds Resources class which initializes, and holds game resources, game info.

I am trying to make it weird(Why? I felt like it).

which one to go
1) weird mini games.
It starts out with the main character dreaming. In some games, there are going to be hints that tell you whether you are in dream or not.
When not in dream, certain mini games will get you killed and game ends.
When in dream, certain games will never end, therefore game over.

When not in dream, if you dont finish a game in a given time limit, game_over or different ending. 
When in dream, if you dont finish a game in a given time limit, you wake up and do the next level (you dont know that you are awake).

So basically the game depends on you're asleep or awake.
Player sometimes gets a hint to figure out, but not always. 

2)
Or simple and easy games.
Glen wants to make it on mobile.
